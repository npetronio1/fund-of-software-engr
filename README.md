# fund-of-software-engr
Repository for Fundamental of Software Engineering class
This project will be used for my class in the fall. It will be used for whatever problem that I will need to solve and used to get to know GitHub more as it is used.
The project is useful because it acts as a living workspace that I am able to edit and test code as necessary. Also, it allows for people to join the project and 
help with the code if needed and suggest helpful ideas.
Users can get help with the project by setting up issues that can be seen by the community. This allows for many eyes on the question and allows for more ideas on how to fix the issues.
I will maintain and contribute to the project.
